name: Modules.Passbook
summary: The Passbook module allows you to access Apple's PassKit APIs
description: |
    ### Requirements
    
    -   iOS 6 or greater

    ### Passbook Resources

    -   [Passbook for Developers](https://developer.apple.com/Passbook/)
    -   [Passbook Kit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Framework/_index.html)

    ### Getting Started

    View the [Using Titanium Modules](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules) document for instructions on getting
    started with using this module in your application.

    ### Accessing the Passbook Module

       To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

        var Passbook = require("ti.passbook");

       The `Passbook` variable is a reference to the Module object.

    ### Setup
        
    Some functions will not be successful on a device without the correct entitlements. 
    To take full advanage of the functionality of this module you will need to setup entitlements for your app.

    ** Note:** It is not necessary to setup entitlements when running on the simulator.

    #### Pass
    1. Go to the Apple provisioning portal **Identifiers** > **Pass Type IDs**
    2. Create a new Pass Type ID
    3. Go to **App IDs**
    4. Create an App ID and enable Passbook for your App ID
    5. Go to **Provisioning Profiles**
    6. Create a new Provisioning Profile and associate it with your App ID
    7. Download and double click your Provisioning Profile
    8. Go to the [Passbook Developer page](https://developer.apple.com/Passbook/) and download the **Example Passes and Sample Code**
    9. In the `pass.json` file of one of the raw passes found in **Example Passes and Sample Code**, replace the value for `passTypeIdentifier` with your Pass Type ID
    10. In the **Example Passes and Sample Code** open the `signpass` project with Xcode and build it
    11. Use the newly created `signpass` command line program to sign the pass that you just edited
    12. You can add your new pass to your device by emailing it to your device or you can drag it into the simulator

    #### Entitlements
    1. Build your project once for device (running on the simulator will not generate the `Entitlements.plist` file we need)
    2. Look in the `build/iphone` folder of your project and find the `Entitlements.plist` file 
    3. Copy the `Entitlements.plist` to the root of your project next to Resources
    4. Edit the `Entitlements.plist` in the root of your project and add the lines below

    To entitle the app for a single pass type ID (replace the Pass Type ID with your own):
        
        <key>com.apple.developer.pass-type-identifiers</key>
        <array>
            <string>$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)pass.com.appc.passkit.lollipop</string>
        </array>

    To entitle the app for all pass type IDs from the provisioning profile (replace the App ID with your own):

        <key>keychain-access-groups</key>
        <array>
            <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.appc.passkit</string>
        </array>

    returns: 
        type: Boolean

  - name: addPass
    summary: Displays the pass to the user and allows them to add the pass to the library or cancel.
    description: |
        Throws an exception if there is a problem with the pass or the add pass view could not be created.

        **Example**

            Passbook.addPass({
